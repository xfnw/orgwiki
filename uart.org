* repurposing a microcontroller as a serial adapter
don't want to buy a dedicated usb-to-serial converter? many
microcontrollers already have one built in! connecting the certain
pins allow disabling the processor, and then you can attach the RX/TX
lines to anything else as you please.

** arduino uno (5v)
connect the ~RESET~ pin to ~GND~ (ground)

** nodemcu esp8266 (3.3v)
connect the ~EN~ (enable) pin to ~GND~
