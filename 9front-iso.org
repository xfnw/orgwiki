5.3 - Building an ISO

The 9front ISO is a livecd that also serves as install media.

Note: Currently, only the 386 and amd64 architectures have downloadable ISOs (rpi has a bootable image). Read: FQA 8.9 - Bootstrapping architectures not included on the ISO for more information on booting other architectures.

~# put your root file system into /n/src9~\\
~bind /root /n/src9~

~# put your hg repository there~\\
~bind -ac /dist/plan9front /n/src9~

~# build the iso~\\
~cd /sys/lib/dist~\\
~mk /tmp/9front.$objtype.iso~

other than that 'hg' should probably be 'git' unless you are using
some ancient 9front version. it seems to work

it also seems to do weird stuff if you are cross-compiling the iso,
you might have to install the target arch as your current
system^{[citation needed]}
