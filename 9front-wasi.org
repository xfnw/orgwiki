#+TITLE: wasi on 9front

the web assembly system interface allows many command-line utilities
to run anywhere, including plan 9! it's like java but simpler, at the
cost of not supporting some stuff like networking.

#+TOC: headlines 2

* runtime
[[https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero][wazero]] is a zero dependency wasi runtime written in go, it mostly
works in 9front

* pre-compiled blobs

** python3
brettcannon has a [[https://github.com/brettcannon/cpython-wasi-build/releases/tag/v3.12.2][build of python 3.12.2]]. running files works, however
~time.sleep()~ errors out due to wazero missing this functionality,
and there appears to be some platform-specific bug with the repl that
causes it to hang on plan 9.

ugh, isn't the whole point of wasm to /not/ have platform-specific bugs!?

** php-cgi
vmware-labs' [[https://github.com/vmware-labs/webassembly-language-runtimes][webassembly-language-runtimes]] has a [[https://github.com/vmware-labs/webassembly-language-runtimes/releases/tag/php%2F8.2.6%2B20230714-11be424][build of php 8.2.6]] in
addition to python and ruby.

#+begin_chat hi
it's a bit out of date though, since [2024-05-31 Fri] they're
seemingly in the process of migrating the repository to some other
organization, who still has not touched it as of [2024-09-15 Sun]
#+end_chat

the ~wasmedge~ variants seem to not be supported by wazero, seems
we're stuck with ~php-cgi~.
