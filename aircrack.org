* debugging
if you cannot enter monitor/promiscuous mode, killing everything using the
interface may help

#+begin_example
airmon-ng check kill
#+end_example

* monitor mode
many guides use deprecated ~iwconfig~ for this, however ~iw~ should be
used instead

#+begin_example
iw <interface> set monitor <mode>
#+end_example
where ~<interface>~ is your device name (ie ~wlan0~), and ~<mode>~ is
what you want to monitor (probably ~control~ or ~none~)

alternatively, starting many aircrack utilities including ~airmon-ng~
or ~besside-ng~ will put it into monitor mode for you

* return to normal networking
you will need to exit monitor mode, set the interface to up, and
restart all the things killed. an easy way to do this is with your
init system's networking (or similar) service.

#+begin_example
service networking restart
#+end_example
will do so on alpine (openrc)
