#+TITLE: compress a git repository
#+SETUPFILE: setupfile.org

git repositories can build up files that are no longer useful, making
them pointlessly large. we can remove them and then recompress the
remaining stuff with these commands from [[https://github.com/Mic92/nixpkgs-review/issues/267#issuecomment-1106276169][SuperSandro2000's comment]].

#+begin_example sh
  git repack -Ad
  git gc
  git prune
#+end_example

you can also ~git gc --aggressive~ first to squeeze it even more.
