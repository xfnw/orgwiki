#+TITLE: create custom compose keybinds with XCompose
#+SETUPFILE: setupfile.org

if you arent on [[./chromeos-blahaj.org][a system without compose]], compose is quite useful for
typing those special characters. however you will quickly be tempted
to add your own compose keybinds!

adding your own compose keybinds is as simple as putting them in a
file called ~.XCompose~ in your home directory
#+begin_example
<Multi_key> <o> <9>	: "â‘¨"	U2468 # CIRCLED DIGIT NINE
#+end_example

you should include your existing compose combinations if you still
want to be able to use them, ie
#+begin_example
include "%L"
#+end_example
to use the predefined compose combinations for your locale. you can
also just hard-code the path directly ignoring your locale, for
example to force US english unicode compose keys, you can put
~/usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose~ instead of ~%L~
