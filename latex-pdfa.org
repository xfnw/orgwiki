#+TITLE: creating accessable PDF/A files with LaTeX
#+SETUPFILE: setupfile.org

my ~latex.org~ setupfile to do this automagically can be found
[[./latex.org][here]]. (if viewing this on the web, you will probably have to change
the extension to ~.org~ get view the raw source)

* tagged pdf
there is currently not a good solution for generating accessable
(tagged) pdfs with LaTeX. the ~accessability~ package is pretty much
the only option, and it barely works.

#+begin_example
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage[english]{babel}
\usepackage[tagged, highstructure]{accessibility}

\pdfpageattr{/StructParents 0/Tabs/S}
#+end_example

* PDF/A

** packages
~hyperref~ and ~pdfx~ let you export as a PDF/A. if exporting from
orgmode, it will automatically include the ~hyperref~ package for you.

#+begin_example
\usepackage{hyperref}
\usepackage[a-3b]{pdfx}
#+end_example

** xmpdata

using a ~filename.xmpdata~, replacing filename with the actual
filename of your tex file, you can specify additional metadata such as
the copyright holder, author, title, etc

any of these macros are optional, here are a few:

#+begin_example
\Title     {Your Title}
\Author    {Vulpinely Vulpine}
\Keywords  {cool\sep
            neat\sep
	    foxes\sep
	    uwu}
\Subject   {this is very abstract}
#+end_example

more macros for the xmpdata file can be found [[./sample.xmpdata][in the sample xmpdata
file]] (borrowed from [[https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/][Peter Selinger's website]])
