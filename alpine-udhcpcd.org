#+TITLE: alpine udhcpcd error
#+SETUPFILE: setupfile.org

whatever you do, do not roll back your boot partition to a previous kernel version, it breaks networking and all the kernel modules

resulting in errors such as this on boot
#+begin_quote
udhcpc: socket(AF_PACKET,2,8): Address family not supported by protocol
#+end_quote

this can be fixed by chrooting in and reinstalling the kernel, in my case ~linux-virt~
