feh is a somewhat minimal image viewer

* keybinds

some of the keybinds arent very well documented

| key | use                                                       |
|-----+-----------------------------------------------------------|
| ~/~ | zoom (out) so that the whole thing fits on your screen    |
| ~r~ | go back to the center and reset zoom                      |
| ~f~ | toggle fullscreen                                         |
| ~Z~ | seems to do the same thing as ~/~, but only in fullscreen |

* set wallpaper
you can use feh for setting your wallpaper with ~--bg-fill~. you can
have a random wallpaper by pointing it at a directory and using
~--randomize~
