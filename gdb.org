| ~d~    | ~delete~    | delete a breakpoint or clear all breakpoints |
| ~si~   | ~stepi~     | do one instruction                           |
| ~s~    | ~step~      | run until reaching a different line          |
| ~n~    | ~next~      | step until the next line                     |
| ~f~    | ~frame~     | show where you are in execution again        |
| ~fin~  | ~finish~    | step until the current funtion returns       |
| ~l~    | ~list~      | show the source code                         |
| ~p~    | ~print~     | get the value of variable                    |
| ~bt~   | ~backtrace~ | show the backtrace                           |

* logging
enable logging to ~gdb.txt~ with ~set log en on~ (short for ~set
logging enabled on~ )

* full backtrace
an extra verbose backtrace can be obtained with ~bt full~. if the
program has multiple threads, this can be applied to all of them with
~th a a bt full~ (short for ~thread apply all backtrace full~)

* debuginfod
gdb supports an automatic debug symbol downloading service called
debuginfod. this means you will usually not have to go search for a
package providing debug symbols for some library and restart your
debugging.
