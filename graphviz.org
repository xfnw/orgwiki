* using it

you can use it [[http://www.google.com/url?q=https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiBhu2An4H8AhXTEFkFHREXByAQFnoECAoQAg&usg=AOvVaw3_6nvfLOYJh713VB5c7nfo][online]], or, if you install it to your computer, the
command to run it will be the layout plugin you want to use, for
example ~dot~

* xfnw's opinionated recommendations

** layout plugin

for directed graphs (ie flowcharts), use ~dot~. for undirected graphs,
use ~fdp~. all the other ones i have either not been able to output
anything meaningful, or layout the data worse than ~dot~ and ~fdp~ 

* examples

** irc LINKS graph

this awk script will take output of irc's ~LINKS~ command, and convert
it to an undirected graphviz graph. change ~$5~ and ~$6~ to where the
two server names are in your log format.

#+begin_fixme
this assumes the letters of servernames are unique! it will break, for
example, if you have both ~me.ow.cat~ and ~meow.cat~
#+end_fixme

#+begin_src awk :tangle tangle/linkstographviz.awk
BEGIN {
	print "graph l {"
}
{
	from=$5;
	to=$6;
	gsub("[\\.-]","",from);
	gsub("[\\.-]","",to);
	print from " [label=\"" $5 "\"]; ";
	if (from != to) {
		print to " -- " from ";"
	}
}
END {
	print "}"
}
#+end_src
