you can expose a pi cam to remote viewing with a cgi script

#+begin_src sh :tangle tangle/full.cgi
#!/bin/sh
echo "Content-Type: image/jpeg"
echo
raspistill -o - -t 1 -n
#+end_src

** make it smol
qvga is smol and bandwidth friendly

#+begin_src sh :tangle tangle/qvga.cgi
#!/bin/sh
echo "Content-Type: image/jpeg"
echo
raspistill -o - -t 1 -n -w 320 -h 240
#+end_src

i also have additional sizes setup, so they can be sent without extra
scaling to my local [[./pixelflut.org][pixelflut]] server.
