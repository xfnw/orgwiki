** get hash

on the web interface, search for the key. the ~Hash=~ value in the
search result will be the md5 hash

** connect to postgres

connnect using the ~psql~ command. if using the nixos module, you will
have to switch to the ~hockeypuck~ user.

sudo -u hockeypuck psql
#+end_example

** get the ~rfingerprint~ value

#+begin_example
select rfingerprint from keys where md5 in ('YOURMD5');
#+end_example

replacing ~YOURMD5~ with the hash you found earlier.

replacing ~YOURRFINGERPRINT~ with the rfingerprint gotten earlier.
