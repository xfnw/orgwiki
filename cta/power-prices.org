* gasoline
1 gasoline = 25 seconds of 80 ku = 1.6666 kud

cant easily buy, have a lot though

* coal or fuel oil
1 coal = 20 seconds of 80 ku = 1.3333 kud

1 coal / 5 mg = 0.2666 kud / mg

1 irl day of power would cost around 40500 mg

fuel oil burns at the same rate, but cant easily buy, have a lot though

* cheapie
.10 mg per kud

1/_ = 10 kud / mg

1 irl day of power would cost around 1080 mg

selling coal in the spawn shop and then using it to buy power from
cheapie gets 37.5 times more power than burning it. cheapie is really
putting the cheapie in cheapie
