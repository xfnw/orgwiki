[[https://codeberg.org/emersion/tlstunnel][tlstunnel]] is a lovely tls reverse-proxy with automagic acme
certificate renewal.

* openbsd
listening on ipv6 when using openbsd seems to be broken, and breaks
acme cert generation. +this can be temporarily fixed by patching
tlstunnel to hardcode listening on your ipv6 interface+

[2023-02-25 Sat]: you do not need to patch it manually anymore!
tlstunnel now supports a [[https://codeberg.org/emersion/tlstunnel/commit/d1812162a86193ff4a50e812c70da63e53b8434f][listen directive]], however it seems you will
have to copy it to every frontend.
