alpine linux is a minimalist linux distro with a super fast package
manager (apk)

* manpages and other documentation

install the ~docs~ metapackage to automatically download the
documentation, or install the packages suffixed with ~-doc~ to install
the documentation for a specific package

note that sometimes the ~-doc~ suffixed package is only for the main
package when you have a few packages with different configurations of
the same software, for example ~emacs-x11~ ~emacs-gtk3~ etc share the
~emacs-doc~ package for their documentation (ew texinfo) which will
not automatically get pulled in by ~docs~

* mouse cursor not changing

[2022-10-08 Sat]: this has been bothering me for like a year, i
finally found the solution by accident today...

if its stuck with the default pointer and never changes (ie when
hovering over text), you are probably missing a video driver. if using
intel graphics, the package is ~xf86-video-intel~

* udhcpcd address family not supported

whatever you do, do not roll back your boot partition to a previous
kernel version, it breaks networking and all the kernel modules

resulting in errors such as this on boot
#+begin_quote
udhcpc: socket(AF_PACKET,2,8): Address family not supported by protocol
#+end_quote

this can be fixed by chrooting in and reinstalling the kernel, if
using a vm, it is ~linux-virt~

* terminal bell (pulseaudio)
pulseaudio will eat the bell by default on alpine, causing the bell to
be silent on terminals like ~xfce4-terminal~ that use it for beeping.

we can get a sound to play by with the ~module-x11-bell~ module and a
sample by adding
#+begin_example
### audible bell
load-sample-lazy x11-bell /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/bell.oga
load-module module-x11-bell sample=x11-bell
#+end_example
to the relevant config file (ie ~/etc/pulse/default.pa~) and
restarting pulseaudio
