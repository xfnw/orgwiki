#+TITLE: ape wine
#+SETUPFILE: setupfile.org

if you have wine installed, linux will annoyingly try to run APE's as windows executables

run
#+begin_src sh
  sudo sh -c "echo ':APE:M::MZqFpD::/bin/sh:' >/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register"
#+end_src

to fix it until the next boot, or 

#+begin_src sh
  sudo sh -c "echo ':APE:M::MZqFpD::/bin/sh:' >/etc/binfmt.d/ape.conf"
#+end_src

for a permanent fix after the next boot if using systemd
