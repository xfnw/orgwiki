#+TITLE: ipv6 link-local multicast

ipv6 has some fancy ips that do fun multicast things

for example, to poke everything on your local link, you can use the
~ff02::1~ all nodes address:
#+begin_example
ping ff02::1%wlan0
#+end_example

there are a bunch more of these, the iana has [[https://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv6-multicast-addresses/ipv6-multicast-addresses.xhtml#link-local][a big list]] of them
