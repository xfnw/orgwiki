#+TITLE: keeping your storage tidy with pacman
#+SETUPFILE: setupfile.org

pacman is a lovely--and decently fast--package manager, used by arch
linux. nothing beats [[./alpine.org][apk]] in speed though :P

#+TOC: headlines 3

* clean stale cache
after verifying all your stuff is in working order, this is safe to
run
#+begin_example
pacman -Sc
#+end_example

** cleaning ALL cache
this one will leave you regretting you did this if a package breaks in
the future, though in my experience and despite arch's reputation,
that will happen quite rarely.
#+begin_example
pacman -Scc
#+end_example

* removing no longer required dependencies
this is somewhat akin to ~apt autoremove~
#+begin_example
pacman -Rns $(pacman -Qttqd)
#+end_example

* somewhat hacky
these might break and are of questionable quality.

** list largest non-dependencies
#+begin_fixme
breaks if you have a package or a field with a capital letter ~N~.
#+end_fixme
#+begin_example
pacman -Qtti | grep 'Name\|Installed Size' | tr "\n" " " | tr "N" "\n" | awk '{print $3 " " $7 $8}' | sort -k2 -h
#+end_example
