[[https://powdertoy.co.uk/][the powder toy]] is a 2D sandbox simulation thing

* magic values

** deut life max amount
despite many places saying the max amount is ~65535~ (16bit unsigned),
life is stored as a 32bit signed integer as of [2023-02-04 Sat].
meaning the maximum value is ~2147483647~ (2^{31} - 1). larger values
will become negative and eventually overflow, which lead to spurious
previous calculations that resulted in identical life[fn:1: previous
incorrect calculations on [2021-03-12 Fri] found it was
~530584300921369395~ (which seems to be nonsense), and on
[2023-01-15 Sun] found it was ~530884300967510015~ (off by a factor of
247212267, but correctly gives the maximum value after overflowing)].

** welding temp for iron
this melts it but will get quickly conducted away

~1700~ with the property editing tool, presumably in celsius

* commands
the console may be entered by pressing the ~`~ (backtick) key.

** pressure
#+begin_example
tpt.set_pressure(nil,nil,nil,nil,200)
#+end_example

will set the pressure to 200 everywhere

** loadfile
the loadfile command will load a lua file relative to your data
directory (or working directory if using old structure), and create an
anonymous function.

#+begin_example
loadfile("cat.lua")()
#+end_example

adding a ~()~, optionally putting in arguments, will call the function
