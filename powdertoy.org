[[https://powdertoy.co.uk/][the powder toy]] is a 2D sandbox simulation thing

* magic values

** deut life max amount
despite many places saying the max amount is ~65535~ (16bit unsigned),
this is only for saves and stamps, the real limit is much higher.
life is stored as a 32bit signed integer as of [2023-02-04 Sat],
meaning the maximum value is ~2147483647~ (2^{31} - 1).

** welding temp for iron
this melts it but will get quickly conducted away

~1700~ \deg{}C with the property editing tool

** filt reasonable heat sensitivity
a ctime of ~1073741792~ (2^{30} - 32) when AND'ing filt will activate
at around 50 \deg{}C.

* commands
the console may be entered by pressing the ~`~ (backtick) key.

** pressure
#+begin_example
tpt.set_pressure(nil,nil,nil,nil,200)
#+end_example

will set the pressure to 200 everywhere

** loadfile
the loadfile command will load a lua file relative to your data
directory (or working directory if using old structure), and create an
anonymous function.

#+begin_example
loadfile("cat.lua")()
#+end_example

adding a ~()~, optionally putting in arguments, will call the function
