press ~C-Space~ to switch to the international keyboard, then you can type ~AltGr-S-0 a~
(AltGr is the alt key on the right) to get the ~å~

[2023-10-28 Sat]: seems they changed ~C-Space~ to only work if you
have an international keyboard layout enabled in the settings. once
you do that it should toggle like before
