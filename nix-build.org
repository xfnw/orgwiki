#+TITLE: nix-build

building a nix package is pretty simple, however the process seems
under-documented

* building a package in the nixpkgs tree
assuming you are at the root of the nixpkgs tree, you can use the ~-A~
option to choose a package to build
#+begin_example
nix-build . -A xcd
#+end_example

* building a maintainer's packages
nixpkgs also includes a fancy convenience script for building all of a
maintainer's packages at once
#+begin_example
nix-build maintainers/scripts/build.nix --argstr maintainer xfnw
#+end_example

* building a nix file with a channel
#+begin_example
nix-build -E "with import <nixpkgs> {}; callPackage ./default.nix {}"
#+end_example

though some special types of packages, such as python ones, have their
own version of ~callPackage~
#+begin_example
nix-build -E "with import <nixpkgs> {}; python3Packages.callPackage ./default.nix {}"
#+end_example
