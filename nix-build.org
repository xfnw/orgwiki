building a nix package is pretty simple, however the process seems
under-documented

* building a package in the nixpkgs tree
assuming you are at the root of the nixpkgs tree, you can use the ~-A~
option to choose a package to build
#+begin_example
nix-build . -A xcd
#+end_example

* building a maintainer's packages
nixpkgs also includes a fancy convenience script for building all of a
maintainer's packages at once
#+begin_example
nix-build maintainers/scripts/build.nix --argstr maintainer xfnw
#+end_example

* building a nix file with a channel
#+begin_example
nix-build -E "with import <nixpkgs> {}; callPackage ./default.nix {}"
#+end_example

though with special types of packages, such as python ones, additional
stuff needs to be pulled into scope
#+begin_example
nix-build -E "with import <nixpkgs> {}; with python3Packages; callPackage ./default.nix {}"
#+end_example

* build all the things
#+begin_example
nix-build -E 'builtins.filter (v: v.type or null == "derivation" && !v.meta.broken) (builtins.attrValues (import ./. {}))'
#+end_example
