* manpages and other documentation

install the ~docs~ metapackage to automatically download the
documentation, or install the packages suffixed with ~-doc~ to install
the documentation for a specific package

note that sometimes the ~-doc~ suffixed package is only for the main
package when you have a few packages with different configurations of
the same software, for example ~emacs-x11~ ~emacs-gtk3~ etc share the
~emacs-doc~ package for their documentation (ew texinfo) which will
not automatically get pulled in by ~docs~

* mouse cursor not changing

[2022-10-08 Sat]: this has been bothering me for like a year, i
finally found the solution by accident today...

if its stuck with the default pointer and never changes (ie when
hovering over text), you are probably missing a video driver. if using
intel graphics, the package is ~xf86-video-intel~
