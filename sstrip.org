#+TITLE: sstrip

* stripping shared objects
unlike normal ~strip~, it is a bad idea to sstrip shared objects.

doing so will cause linker errors like
#+begin_example
/usr/bin/ld: /usr/lib/sstripped.so: error adding symbols: file in wrong format
#+end_example

which is quite an unhelpful error message because everyone else
running into it seems to instead be attempting to cross compile
incorrectly...
