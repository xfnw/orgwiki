#+TITLE: xfnw's org wiki thing
#+SETUPFILE: setupfile.org

hello, you might find some stuff here

* an offline-first wiki
all  relevant  referenced  content  should  be  included  in  [[https://owen.bellz.org/git/orgwiki/][the  git
repository]] to avoid link-rot and  to work offline. despite this, after
following  the instructions  on the  [[./git-compression.org][git-compression]] page,  the entire
wiki's repository is currently under  1mb in size (although the actual
size  is somewhat  larger,  as  each page  tries  to  be a  standalone
document, which would benefit from deduplication)

* generated with org-mode
its like wikitext but more consistent!  learn more on the [[./about.org][about page]].
