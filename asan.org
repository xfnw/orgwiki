address sanitizer is google's cool memory checker thingy

sadly, it [[https://github.com/google/sanitizers/issues/1080][does not support musl libc]]

* using it
if your compiler has address sanitizer support, add
~-fsanitize=address~ to your ~CFLAGS~. you probably also want ~-g~
debug symbols, to make address sanitizer output more useful.
