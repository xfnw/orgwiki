#+TITLE: Ɛ is not epsilon: a mini-rant about a seo spam site

recently i came across a website about a unicode character,
backwards3[.]info, which is apparently dedicated to telling everyone
that the Ɛ "backwards 3" character is called epsilon.

not linking to it directly because the rest of that site appears to be
just seo spam stuff
#+end_chat

except wait, ε is the actual epsilon character, and it's a lot
smaller. maybe Ɛ is the capitalized version? well no, greek capital
letter epsilon is Ε. what the heck is Ɛ then?

#+begin_chat hi
let's feed it to [[https://crates.io/crates/unicode_names2][unicode_names2]]!

Ɛ is latin capital letter open e. that's right, the entire premise of
backwards3[.]info is so backwards (hehe) that they chose a character
from a completely different alphabet...
