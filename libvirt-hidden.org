#+TITLE: hide that a libvirt guest is in a vm
#+SETUPFILE: setupfile.org

* not much performance impact

** pass through cpu in information
this can also be done as a toggle switch in virt-manager's cpu section

#+begin_example
<cpu mode="host-passthrough" check="none" migratable="on"/>
#+end_example

[2022-09-22 Thu]: maybe try ~check="partial"~ instead? someone recommended
that however i cannot find any documentation on what it does

** pass through bios information
#+begin_example
<os>
  <smbios mode="host"/>
</os>
#+end_example

* lots of performance impact

** disabling hypervisor optimisations
#+begin_example
<qemu:commandline>
  <qemu:arg value='-cpu'/>
  <qemu:arg value='host,hv_time,kvm=off,hv_vendor_id=null,-hypervisor'/>
</qemu:commandline>
#+end_example

seems to disable KVM too. sad.

** using non-virtio drivers
they make vm's much faster but are easy to detect
