* converting between logic and data values
in logisim, inputs and outputs have a 'bitwidth', kind of like a
'type' in a programming language. normal logic gates and stuff have a
bitwidth of 1.

a 'splitter' (in the wiring category) can be used to convert between
different bitwidths. set the 'fan out' value to the number of
connections you want on a side (the other side will always have one)
and 'bit width in' to the bitwidth you want for the side with one
connection. there is no 'reverse splitter'; despite the name and the
'bit width in' option, the splitter can be used in reverse direction,
combining stuff into one output if you want!
