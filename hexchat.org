* running script commands on connect
the on-connect commands tab in the server settings seem to not like
script commands. you can (ab)use ~timer~ to search for script
commands.

#+begin_example
timer 1 mycoolcommand meow
#+end_example

* M-a
the keybind ~M-a~ (aka ~alt+a~ for non-[[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/cslkqc/comment/exfsx61/][emacsulates]]) in hexchat is
*hardcoded* in the gtk frontend to toggling away, in contrast to other
clients which use this for channel switching.

to change it, you must change the source code and recompile. [[https://github.com/xfnw/hexchat][my
hexchat fork]] does this, allowing you to bind it like any other key.
