* tangling
src blocks with a ~:tangle filename~ will get tangled

* detangling
maybe untangling too?

** comments
detangle requires comments be put into the source file to work. stick
~:comments link~ to your ~#+begin_src~ line to enable these. to enable
them for all tangle blocks, use ~#+PROPERTY~:

#+begin_example
#+PROPERTY: header-args :tangle yes :comments link
#+end_example
