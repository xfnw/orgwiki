* precedence

options are done in order, so an option needs to be before other
options to effect them. for example to turn off dithering with
~+dither~, you have to put that before other things that would use
dithering.

* colors

** invert colors
use the ~-negate~ option

** convert colors to monochrome
use the ~-monochrome~ option

** convert to grayscale
use ~-colorspace gray~.

you can limit the number of colors with ~-colors~ and turn off
dithering with ~+dither~, though this seems to really highlight
artifacts if using jpeg.

occationally, especially if you only have a few colors, this can
actually produce larger file sizes than just normal indexed colors. if
using PNG, you can prefix the filename with ~PNG8:~ to force normal
colors which can then be indexed using something like [[./pngo.org][pngo]]. do check
the size though, this can also make the size much larger.

** remove alpha
use the ~-flatten~ option for this. you can also set the ~-background
color~ to a color beforehand if you want to replace the alpha with a
specific color.

** local automatic threshold
the ~-lat~ option takes window dimentions and an offset as an
argument, and then does a local Otsu threshold to get 1-bit color
that still preserves detail even with darker/lighter areas.

may benefit from ~-flatten~ and ~-colorspace gray~ beforehand. oddly
this sometimes makes it output fully transparent images, not sure why
but an offset of -1 (ie ~30x30-1~) seems to fix this...
