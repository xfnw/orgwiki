* switch from kubernetes?
i am thinking of switching my [[./k8s.org][kubernetes]] cluster to an incus one,
managing both containers and virtual machines in one place seems neat.
also, at least from my cursory look, [[https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/][the incus documentation]] feels a
lot more useful than kubernetes'. not sure how i feel about the system
containers instead of application containers part though, i would like
to at least somewhat declaratively configure applications to host.

#+begin_chat hi
[[https://kubevirt.io/][kubevirt]] does exist, but it is a bit odd
