Pixelflut is a simple protocol for collaboratively editing pixels

#+TOC: headlines 3

* protocol

there are 3 commands in the official specs, ~HELP~ ~SIZE~ and ~PX~

- ~HELP~ returns a small helptext.
- ~SIZE~ returns the resolution of pixels you can edit, in the form of ~SIZE <x> <y>~, for example ~SIZE 1366 768~
- ~PX <x> <y>~ returns the color of the pixel at that position, in the form of ~PX <x> <y> <color>~, for example ~PX 400 20 00FF00~
- ~PX <x> <y> <color>~ sets the color of the pixel at that position and does not have to return anything

however some implementations add extra commands, like ~OFFSET~

* fun

** awk
you can pipe your pixelflut lines through ~awk(1)~ to have interesting
effects, for example making images bendy

#+begin_src awk :tangle flutskew.awk
{$2=($2+($3**1.7)/60) % 1024; print}
#+end_src
