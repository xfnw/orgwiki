pngo is [[https://causal.agency/][june]]'s [[https://causal.agency/bin/pngo.html][png optimisation tool]].

seeing as there is no helptext and i have not bothered to install the
manpage, here are some common options:

* setting output location
by default, it will overwrite the file in place. the ~-o filename~
lets you specify the output location. alternatively ~-c~ sends to
stdout.

* force bit depth
the ~-b~ option can reduce the number of bits used for each color.
