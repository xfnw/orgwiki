a fork of [[./firefox.org][firefox]] that is somewhat privacy focused

* url bar overzealously searching
enable ~browser.fixup.dns_first_for_single_words~ in about:config to
make it check for hostnames instead of forcing them to be searches

* url bar hiding protocol
turn off ~browser.urlbar.trimURLs~ in about:config

* space beside url bar
to remove the wasted space, right click on them and go to Customize
Toolbar, then you can right click on the same place again and Remove
from Toolbar

not sure why this requires being in the customizing toolbar mode, the
list all tabs button has an option to remove it without being in the
customizing mode...

* dark theme not working
the ~ResistFingerprinting~ option intentionally breaks
~prefers-color-scheme~ :(

#+begin_chat vulpine/eepy
at least it actually tells you this in the settings now, instead of
just silently not working...
#+end_chat

* extra settings i like
- disable Use smooth scrolling
- enable Always show scrollbars
