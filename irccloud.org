* irc ident
irccloud's ident strings start with either ~uid~ or ~sid~, which
signify it is an unpaid or paid account respectively. next is the
incremental decimal account id number, which uniquely identifies each
account. if a free account is upgraded to a paid one, the ~uid~ will
change to ~sid~, but the number will not change.

this means to ban an irccloud user, it is a good idea to use a
~?~ (any single character) wildcard like so:
#+begin_example
*!?id12345@*.irccloud.com
#+end_example
