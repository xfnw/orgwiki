#+TITLE: lavfi live oscilloscope
#+SETUPFILE: setupfile.org

this pipeline turns your pulseaudio monitor into an oscilloscope using
ffmpeg, lavfi, and mpv

#+begin_example
ffmpeg -f pulse -i 0 -acodec copy -flags low_delay -fflags nobuffer -f wav - |
mpv - --config=no --background=color --mute -untimed --profile=low-latency \
--lavfi-complex='[aid1]asplit[ao][a1];[a1]avectorscope=r=25:m=lissajous_xy:bc=100:gc=100:rc=75:bf=255:gf=80:rf=255:mirror=y:zoom=1[vo]' \
#+end_example

dispite all the low latency options stuck on there, there's still
around a half-second of latency. this can be squeezed down slightly by
using the seek bar in mpv to move it to the end, but even then there
is still slight latency

you can add ~:draw=line~ to the ~--lavfi-complex~ option to draw lines
instead of dots, which can make complex stuff render better, at the
cost of it becoming somewhat blocky and giving lines to things that
would normally be moving fast enough to be somewhat hidden
